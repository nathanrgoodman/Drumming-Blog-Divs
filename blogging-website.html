    <h2><em>New Cymbal // 3-15-20</em></h2>
    <p>Today like any other Sunday, I headed to some of the local music shops around my area. While out at one of the shops I came across an early series Zildjian A-Custom series 22" ping ride for only $120! This thing is in great condition and sounds phenominal, in love already after 3 days.</p>

    <h2><em>Fixing Snare Wire // 3-03-2020</em></h2>
    <p>We have lost a comrad today ladies and gents. It is to my displeasure to inform that my beloved original snare wire has snapped. In between crying and anger, i mustered up the strength to drive to the local guitar center to pick out a new wire. I scanned the wall but alas nothing could come close to the original, all the memories, new ones ceasing to exist...Then I got over myself and bought the cheapest one they had, put it on and it sounds exactly the same.</p>

    <h3>Here's a little bit about me</h3>
    <p>I was born on 05/28/2000 in Portland, Oregon. I've spent my whole life in Oregon and it is my home. Music was introduced to me at an early age, taking guitar lessons at 7 was when it all started. Shortly after lessons started, the shop closed leaving me to find other hobbies. I didn't pick up a pair of dumsticks until I was 14, and I immediately knew that was my new found passion. I've been playing for over 6 years now and throughout have discovered styles and rythyms in music I never even knew could exist. Even though it is not my carrer it is still my dream.</p>
